# Project-1-EasyA

EasyA is a web based application designed to help students analyze the grading history of courses and instructors. 
Students can use historical grade data to compare grading distributions and make informed decisions about which classes and instructors to choose.
You can find the classes that have the highest chance of giving you an A. This project was made for CS 422.

## Features

**User Page:**  
  The user page is designed for students to filter, compare, and visualize grade distributions interactively.  
  - **Dynamic Filtering Dropdowns:**  
    - Filter by department, class, or instructor. The available options update dynamically based on the user’s selections (e.g., selecting a department will filter the classes and instructors shown).  
    - Departments can be sorted by class levels (e.g., 100-level, 200-level, up to 400-level classes).  
  - **Grade Comparison Buttons:**  
    - The page allows users to toggle between viewing **A, B, C, D, or F** grade distributions using buttons that dynamically reload the graph.  
  - **Graph Visualization:**  
    - The grade data is displayed using **Chart.js** in a bar graph format for easy comparisons.
  
**Admin Page:**
  The admin page allows administrators to load historical grade data from a remote JavaScript file or scrape faculty information using predefined department URLs.
  - **Load Remote JS:** Extracts course and instructor information from the provided JS data file and stores it in the MongoDB database.
  - **Faculty Scraper:** Scrapes faculty names and department associations from archived department pages. 
  - **Database Management:** There are options to clear or update current database records.


## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Project-1-EasyA.git
   cd Project-1-EasyA

2. **Build and Run the Containers:**
   - Run the following command to build the project and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build

3. **Access the Application:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```bash
   Navigate to http://localhost:5000/admin to load data.
   Navigate to http://localhost:5000/user to view course and instructor comparisons. 

## How to use
- Admin Page:
  - Load data either by specifying a remote JavaScript URL or by running the web scraper.
    - Web scrape URL: https://web.archive.org/web/20141107201343/http://catalog.uoregon.edu/arts_sciences/
    - JS URL: https://emeraldmediagroup.github.io/grade-data/gradedata.js
  - Clear and reload the database when needed.
 
- User Page:
  - Use the dropdown menus to filter department, instructor, or class to dynamically update graphs
  - Use the grade buttons (A, B, C, D, or F) to switch between different grading distributions.
  - View bar graphs representing the percentage of selected grades.
